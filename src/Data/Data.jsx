    $154,201,673 in just the opening weekend. 4440 theaters showcasing it for an average of nine and a half weeks. Rank one in not only the domestic, but also the international and worldwide box office for digital animation movies. The immense success of Disney Pixar's new movie Inside Out 2 is indisputable. Diving deeper into the complexity of emotions with the young main character Riley going through puberty and experiencing new emotions, the animation studio once again managed to captivate countless people. And to no one's surprise. With focusing on a topic such as emotions, that we all have and experience, they obtained a broad audience of people that can relate and could be interested. We all experienced joy. We all experienced sadness. We all experienced anger, fear, disgust, anxiety, envy, etc. We all can relate and understand. But did they really do a good job in portraying something as complex as emotions? And what are emotions even?

**What are emotions?**
    According to the American Psychological Association “emotions are conscious mental reactions (such as anger or fear) subjectively experienced as strong feelings usually directed toward a specific object and typically accompanied by physiological and behavioral changes in the body”. That is quite a complicated explanation for a question that most people would just answer with “feelings”, or “a psychological response”. So let's unpack that answer.
    
	Generally, an emotion is a response to a situation. Situations lead to thoughts - then thoughts on the other hand, lead to feelings, which finally lead to behavior. Our perception of the world essentially is a chain reaction. Situation > Thought > Feeling > Behavior. An example for this is this: You see one of your friends on the other side of the street. They do look towards you. You wave, but they don't wave back. A situation that many of us might have experienced before. Suddenly, a thought pops into your mind. “Why did they just ignore me? Don't they like me anymore?” A noticeable stinging suddenly appears, making your chest feel heavy with a wave of sadness and pain overcoming you. The next day - their birthday - you sit on your phone with a “Happy birthday!” text ready to be sent. But you delete it. The sadness their ignorance caused, makes you want to avoid them. 
    
	And that is the gist of how emotions work and influence us. Emotions essentially are a reaction to situations. That is something we also see in both parts of Inside Out. Whenever something happens to Riley the emotions show different responses. One good example for that is when Riley meets her new best friends Bree and Grace. In the movie Grace holds a presentation in class about how small amounts of money like change stuck in the couch, can make a difference. However, clumsily she trips and lets her jar full of coins shatter. There you see a vastly different response from Disgust and Joy. “Oh, no! We need to do something”, is Joy's first reaction, while Disgust immediately proclaims to not do so because “that girl is a social titanic” and their involvement would lead to Riley being one as well. It perfectly shows that depending on our thoughts, different emotions may overtake us. Going back to our previous example, we could avoid the anger. Instead of jumping to the assumption that the friend doesn't like us anymore, we could jump to another thought. If we were to think “Well, I just dyed my hair, so maybe he didnt recognize me” our emotional response would be neutral. We would not feel bad about it, still send happy birthday messages and we would keep our friend. We could also think “Oh, he seems lost in thoughts, that is probably why he did not see me”. That on the other hand would lead to concern overtaking our emotions. We check in with our friend and they might open up to us about something going on in their life. Eventually, that brings us closer and our relationship changes to becoming best friends.
    
	As you can see the thought that directs our actions is essential in deciding which emotional response will be caused. The first thought that comes to our mind often is associated with our core beliefs4, which also beautifully gets displayed in the movie. Riley's core belief makes her go with Joy's idea. She gets up from her seat and goes to help Grace to pick up the money. And so does Bree, which leads to the three of them becoming best friends. It is a beautiful way of representing how one's beliefs influence the emotional response and it is accurate as well. N. Curry and others in their research explains how thoughts can turn into core beliefs. But sadly, they do not always turn into as positive core beliefs as Riley had in that moment. With Anxiety kicking out all the basic emotions and having the more complex emotions take over, this is also shown in the movie and a dysfunctional cycle gets created.

**Anxiety and the dysfunctional cycle **
    The way anxiety took over is something many of us can probably relate to. Most people have reached points in their life, in which they were overwhelmed or underwent a lot of change, such as Riley did. Those are moments in which we are very vulnerable to dysfunctional cycles. And so was Riley. The abrupt change of going to a new school soon without her two best friends, the need to fit in with the friend group of her idol, to impress the coach to get into the new team - lots of changes, lots of pressure. One of the central core beliefs that Anxiety created and that Riley is living on is “I am not good enough”. A simple thought that quickly turned into a core belief, creating a vicious cycle. A cycle, which is based on a negative assumption of Riley not being good enough. A self-critical thought, turned into an anxious feeling. Over and over again. Eventually causing inappropriate behavior. Denying her true self, neglecting her friends and even breaking into the coaches office. 

	With hundreds of million people being its victims, anxiety disorder is the most common mental disorder. Yet only one in four people get their anxiety treated (if you need help, please contact your closest helpline ). But as bad as anxiety makes us all feel, and as much as many of us might wish for our anxiety to just disappear, the emotion itself still has its right to exist. 

**The reasons for emotions **
    The scientific research on the development of emotions could probably be a topic for a whole book. But broken down it is a dispute between three parties: Those believing emotions are of natural descent, those advocating the idea of emotions being nurtured, and those who believe that it is a mix of both options. Nowadays the mixed option has been gaining more and more followers. Interestingly some of those ideas are also partly displayed in the movie and - maybe unintentionally - advocated by the movie-goers. 

  “Basic emotions are developed from universal biological mechanisms. Complex emotions are founded on these [...]”, says Oatley and others in “Towards a Cognitive Theory of Emotions”. To break this down, the idea is about basic emotions being those we are born with, as we need them in our day to day life. There are many discussions about how many there are. Many settle for the Big 6, some consider it to be many more, but we will look at the five that Oatley and others consider the basic emotions: Joy (often referred to as happiness), Sadness, Fear, Anger and Disgust. Noticed something? Those are the five main characters from the first part! So let's look further into why those are considered the basic emotions and why we need them. 

         **Joy**, the energy bundle of the movie! It is something we all live for: Happiness. Whilst it might just be an amazing feeling to many, that we aim to achieve, it does have much more use to us than you might think. Happiness promotes repetitive behavior of the things that make us feel joy and also promotes many social bounding aspects. An example for this would be good feedback for a presentation. The approval makes us experience joy and thus leads to us associating positive feedback with positive emotions. We will aim to continue to archive those. Therefore joy should not be considered as simple of an emotion as many do. Joy is what keeps us motivated and what we can look forward to. 

         **Sadness** goes from being ostracized in the first movie9, to finally being accepted in the end. Even though the character is an adorable representation of it, no one really enjoys experiencing sadness. And that is okay, because that is how it is supposed to be. Being sad is a cry for help. It signals for help and maybe even self-reflect after a negative experience. Losing a loved one is a sad, but good example for this. While going through grief, the sadness you experience might make you reach for comfort with your friends and help you reflect on the people that still are there. It makes you re-evaluate the relationships and helps you process the grief. 

         **Fear** is probably a more obvious one for this. Of course we need fear to protect ourselves! From dangerous animals back in the day, to scamming con-artists nowadays. Triggering your flight or fight response and securing survival is Fear's job. If we wake up by a loud unknown noise at night, it is the fear that makes us take action and not just fall asleep again. 

         **Anger** on the other hand might not seem as important to survival as some of the others, but it certainly is. It is responsible for protecting your own boundaries. If someone steals your hard earned chocolate bar at lunch break, of course you have a right to be angry! Assertively confrontation the perpetrator with their deed is part of protecting your own survival. 

         **Disgust** is very important to survival as well though. Would you ever bite into a rotting piece of food? No? That is because you are disgusted by it. It makes sure to keep us from consuming things that could make us sick, or as in the movie, that could cause our social downfall. 

    And the end of the first movie does confirm all of this as well. It makes sure to show the audience that all emotions are accepted and needed. No matter how awful some of them might feel, we need them to get through life. Not only them, we also need the more complex emotions as well. Experiencing multiple emotions at once is already something shown in the 2015 animation. The memories that not only are one color, but two colors, became frequently common. That is something that people certainly picked up on fast as well! Something that people on Reddit came up with are “emotion charts”. These charts give names to the emotions that are founded from two basic emotions. An example for this would be joy and fear being named “excitement”. And that is what a complex emotion is described as. Interestingly, you can also find some of the new characters' names in some of the emotion charts that go around in the internet. For example nostalgia, being a mix between sadness and joy, whilst anxiety is showcased as a mix of fear and sadness. And even the movie describes Rileys life to be “more complex now, it requires more sophisticated emotions than [...]” just the basic ones. And that is growing up, isn't it? Our world gets more and more complicated and so does our life. Therefore, also the things we experience get more complex. But in the end, even if these emotions may seem annoying at some point in our lives, they are here to help us. 

       **Anxiety** explains why Riley needs her in the movie herself. Whilst fear is mostly responsible for protecting her from current threats, anxiety is responsible for protecting her from future threats. It is an emotion that helps us prepare for what is to come, for example an exam. If you fear an exam, the anxiety will hopefully cause you to prepare for it sufficiently, thus increasing the chances of you passing. 

        **Envy** on the other hand can be used to compare ourselves to others. Comparing yourself is nowadays often considered a bad thing, however, it can be good. If you compare yourself to see where you can improve and use that as motivation, it helps you develop into the person that you yourself are proud of to be.

     **Embarrassment** makes sure to continue a feeling of social acceptance after breaking a norm. Let's say you interrupted someone when talking. You should apologize, before it becomes an embarrassing situation. Like making sure that the other person does not perceive you as someone who doesn't care about social norms. 

       **Ennui** describes a feeling of dissatisfaction and boredom. Boredom is essentially also one of our very helpful emotions. It makes us seek out new challenges instead of staying static. That is also why some of the most creative ideas are born out of boredom! 

      **Nostalgia**, finally, is the last emotion shown in Inside Out 2. When looking through old pictures, we all might experience nostalgia. Generally it is often used to give us emotional resilience by connecting us to old memories. This can greatly help getting through difficult situations as they give a sense of comfort or maybe even continuity. 

  Thus, we can see that every emotion is somehow needed in our life. We can't just all be happy all the time, as Joy wanted Riley to be in the first part. There is a vast range of emotions for a reason and experiencing them all is part of life. But we can't forget to always keep a balance of those! Having one emotion be too present, such as anxiety, is not healthy for us either. 

**The balance** 
   In the end there is lots that can be said about emotions. Lots that can be researched, lots that we still need to learn, but only few amounts of knowledge that genuinely concerns the average person. Whilst it is good to have a grasp on the basics, the amount of needed knowledge that the Inside Out movies provide is sufficient. And both movies also draw a conclusion to the most important part we have to be aware of: All emotions are valid and balance is everything.  Anxiety does understand that at the end too. It is greatly displayed how she went from being an overly controlling character, that has to know every possible future, to one that focuses on the things that she can influence. Joy certainly did a good job here too by asking the right question to comfort Anxiety: “We can't control if Riley makes the team, but what can we control?”. Shifting one's focus on the tangible is indeed one of the best options when sinking too deep into all the disasters available. This is not only something that counts for the feeling of anxiety however. Experiencing one emotion way too much, such as envy being another good example, is a way of your emotions signaling an underlying problem to yourself. So why not sit down for a moment and think about it? Is there an emotion taking over your life? And if yes, what does it signal to you with it? If it is something that is out of your control, please do not feel afraid of getting professional help .

export const TippingPointsText=`   Acceleration of the mass loss from Greenland's ice-sheets, record heats and large-scale dying of coral reefs. 2023 and 2024 have both been years swamped with news about climate issues. Many of these things have one thing in common, they are all connected to a concept called tipping points. Climate tipping points are thresholds that, when exceeded, will cause inevitable and most likely irreversible change to our current climate and systems. This considers rather catastrophic influences, which can cause issues with climate stability. So, essentially something humanity should aim to prevent, right? Science definitely recommends observing and preventing them. However, science and politics don't always work fully alongside each other. 

**Influence of tipping points**
    In his groundbreaking 2009 paper Joachim Schnellhuber first introduced the concept of tipping points. It warns about how the drastically increasing temperature can essentially lead to an increased trigger speed of these tipping points. As in depth knowledge as Schnellhuber was able to give with his research vastly changed the view on global warming. It did not take long for the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel Climate Change) to include tipping points in their reports, which quickly led to it also being part of all sorts of discourses in the field of climate change. At first the concept of tipping points was much met with skepticism and alarm. Over time evidence of tipping points became more clear, e.g. through the continuous melting ice-sheets etc. It became more and more evident that the urgent need to protect our climate is not something we can push to the next generation, but something that we have to focus on now. This eventually led to climate problems being thoroughly discussed during the meetings for the Paris agreement in 2015. Vulnerable nations - such as small islands - especially pushed the arguments, eventually being a significant contributor to the notorious decision to target a maximal allowed change of 1.5°C, as higher changes would trigger those irreversible changes the tipping points bring with it. Overall this sounds like a thorough plan, which would avoid the catastrophes. So, where did it fail?
Schellnhuber, H.J. (2009). "Tipping elements in the Earth System." 

**Europe's climate engagement** 
    The European Union is known for being a strong advocate for green thinking. A good example for this is set in The European Green Deal by striving to be the first continent to be climate neutral. With a goal of no net emissions of greenhouse gasses by 2050, decoupling economic growth and much more, the EU strives to take Schellnhubers warnings seriously. A significant point of their work lies in their coal-phase out plans, which essentially requires the countries that take part in the green deal to take part in a clean and efficient energy transition. In fact, it is what many focus on, as many consider emissions to be one of the main contributors to climate change. 
    One compelling plan for this is the German Energiewende. The final goal is for 80% of the energy usage to be transitioning to renewable energies by the year 2030. This plan already started in 2000. With current news about the climate issues, Germany seems to have felt the urge to even speed up their current process even more. Almost doubling the results from 2021, they now plan to increase the expansion speed by three times. The first half of 2024 already covers 57% of the energy usage, putting only 23% away from its final goal. Aside from that Germany also achieved CO2 emissions that are 46% lower than in 1990 in the previous year. Thus, the country definitely greatly contributes to the EUs plan of a timely change in the reduction of greenhouse emissions, however, not everything is going as well as it seems. The country plans to have a complete coal phase out until 2038. Many critics believe that this is not a timely enough manner. Suggestions expect a phase out to already be happening by 2030 to be able to keep up with certain goals. However, there are many voices that deny climate issues entirely and call it a hysteria. One of those voices belongs to the AfD, which currently is one of the leading parties in Germany. As the party currently received an increase in influence after the last elections, it can to some part be expected that the already slow coal phase out will not end up happening faster, but maybe even slower. This definitely is something the country has to look out for. 
    Belgium, with Brussels being a political meeting point, seems to take the EUs plans also very close to its heart. Having a roadmap for the net-zero initiative, that essentially aligns fully with the EUs plans, shows an immense effort. Some critics say that its implementation seems rather slow, yet the government seems to hold the environment in high regard by trying their best to keep up with it. However, Belgium has not been that high with its emissions in the first place as it has been a very nuclear energy reliant country. Nuclear energy might be a different very debated topic, which the country seems to understand as well, however, only 2% of their electricity is currently supplied through coal, leading to a significantly lower contribution to emissions than other countries. The nuclear energy in itself is also planned to be put to a stop until 2032 with two plants already being shut down. 50% of the country's electricity is already made up from renewable energies, alongside nuclear power that makes a significant amount. The main issue for Belgium seems transportation emissions - and to no one's surprise - as a country as international as it is, there has to be a lot of traveling. Solely the transportation emissions from politicians traveling to brussels is rather high. Not to mention its closeness to other countries, making it easily possible to travel to the Netherlands or France, which language belgians already speak. Whilst being an understandable problem, it is something that the coin try definitely has to work on to reduce its overall emotions even further. 
    We can already see a repeating pattern here. A lot of Europe's initiative lies in their change of reducing emissions and renewable energies. Just as Belgium, France for example also is a leading nuclear energy user, yet struggling to not rely on it as much anymore. Whilst other countries struggle to have a fast change to nuclear powers. However, Schellnhuber suggests that taking care of the emissions sadly is not enough. He says that the climate goals stated in the Paris agreement will blunder eventually. Thus, he suggests finding the solution in architecture by changing concrete to timber as it leads to a lot less emissions and the planting of timber would also contribute to the climate. How that will end is something we will eventually find out. Currently it is clear that the EUs and its countries are trying, but sadly not enough yet. To preserve our climate and keep catastrophes from happening there will need to be more happening. But whilst Europe is trying a lot, it is not the only country influencing the world's future. 


**Americas climate engagement** 
	  Going over climate in the United States is genuinely a wild ride. 2017 Trump announced in June that the US will withdraw the Paris agreement, which they previously joined in 2015. Even though the process of leaving took quite a while, eventually the US was out of the agreement. There were many negative responses to Trump's decisions, however, not everyone viewed it as negatively. Leaving the agreement was one of the major parts in his campaign, claiming that it is unfair that countries such as China are left free to use fossil fuel and the US could not. Thus, there were quite a handful of people that supported his decisions. While it is definitely a topic that could be up for some heavy debating in the end one thing is clear: It made the US contribute more towards passing the thresholds of the tipping points. Aside from that inconsistent federal policies and slow transition to renewable energy sources has been something that the US received critice for for quite some while. So, Biden deciding to rejoin the agreement in 2021 was much welcome for climate activists. It is a huge step towards more contribution in climate fields. Not only that, but the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is probably the biggest contributor towards climate that the US has made thus far. The IRA has made significant investments in climate policies, which are predicted to reduce the emissions by around 40% until 2030.
    Brazil plays a significant role in the fight for the prevention of tipping points. The Amazon rainforest is one of the tipping points that can cause catastrophic issues if it is surpassed. Sadly, however, when 2019 Jair Bolsonaro came into power, the attempts of sustaining the rainforest that Lula did previously were thrown out of the window. Not only did he cut funds for science, he also fired numerous environmental experts. During his reign the deforestation of the Amazon greatly went up again. Around 34.000 km2  were deforested in that time. That is 4.000 more than the landmass of the entire country of Belgium. With 17% of the rainforest gone that specific tipping point seems hardly avoidable. However, Lula da Silva's government is doing their best to take a more climate friendly reign again. So, all left to do is hope that he will succeed in his plans, such as halting the deforestation.


**The black sheeps of climate?** 
    Often when talking about climate change, there are some countries that are considered the black sheeps. One of the most notorious ones being Russia. It is one of the biggest fossil fuel suppliers in the world, thus heavily relying on it to keep its current economy going. Additionally Russia has a very limited engagement in climate policies. It essentially is known to be a country that stays away from actively searching answers. Instead Russia is known to look for answers proactively. They also do not show much effort to align with international partners. With all this the description of being a black sheep is fairly fitting. However, in Russia's most recent climate doctrine they did admit that climate change is one of the most significant factors to look out for. Thus, there might be a sparkle of hope left in Russia finally taking initiative in climate actions. 
    Another black sheep is China, as it has the biggest CO2 Emission output worldwide. So, thinking of it as a black sheep is fair. However, there is indeed a very small margin between good and bad actions towards the climate. Whilst the country does produce an immense amount of coal, it also is the leading country in terms of renewable energy use. The country sells an immensely huge amount of electric vehicles, expecting almost half of the car sales to be electric ones by 2027. Then again it is a country that has a huge issue with air pollution, especially in bigger cities such as Beijing. China is a rather torn country, that seems to try, but that has too many climate problems to handle at once. For an economy that relies on its industrial sector and is big on the coal market, it is difficult, but necessary, to quit these. And with a country with a landmass as huge as Chinas it also is rather difficult to manage and supply all its citizens with renewable energy and keep everyone on board with its plans. All we can do is hope that China keeps crying and improving on its climate agenda. As it is the largest Emitter and has an enormous amount of land, it is important for China to play a huge role in climate change actions. 


    In the end there is much to be said about climate policies. Climate is a very sensitive issue, that is more urgent than it ever was. Getting closer to many of the tipping points, we can not just simply watch. We all have to act. There is no point in fighting about who should take the responsibility and just pushing the solutions further away, as some do. It is true that some are more responsible than others, but in the end everyone is responsible for their own lives and every country is responsible for the life of its inhabitants. There is no point in fully prioritizing the money they make from coal, fossil fuels, oil etc., if there will not be a place to use it at. We need a world to live in to use these things. Our world should be our highest priority, as it is our home. And where would we be without a home? 


`
export const AntarcticaText=`
    When thinking about Antarctica most people would probably think of polar bears, penguins, massive sheets of ice and a bitter cold temperature. Maybe some thoughts about the south pole and Santa Claus are not too far fetched either. And those are fairly logical thoughts. There are penguins and polar bears living in Antarctica. Additionally, the on average two kilometers thick ice is also an undeniable obvious identifier of the continent, as well as its icy temperatures. But as a child I always asked myself, what is below the ice? And even today I am still fairly curious about it. So today, I want to fulfill the curiosity of the child in me. Let's take a look at what is underneath the Antarctic ice and how it came to be as it is today. 

**Discovery of the land underneath**
    The curiosity of what is beneath the ice is not only something that children might ask, but something that researchers were curious about as well. Thus, a long search for answers began. Thanks to modern technology, we have already gained quite a decent amount of answers as well. Satellite data as well as the use of plains equipped with ice-penetrating radars greatly contributed to us now having a decent map of the land beneath the ice. This is a huge breakthrough for both science and history, as essentially this reveals the past of the lands, which again can contribute to plans of the future. So why not take a journey into this lost land and take a look at what more the Antarctic land has to offer than polar bears and ice? 

**Painting a picture of its history** 
Late Precambrian Era (600 million years ago) 
    Let's go back in time to Rodinia. Instead of having the world's landmass be split up in many, it is one supercontinent containing the majority of it in one place. Not only South and North America, but also Africa, Australia and Antarctica are fully part of that one continent. A giant continent that eventually has to find its end. The end for many things in existence, but also a whole new beginning. 
**Cambrian Period (541 to 485 million years ago) **
    The end of Rodinia is marked by a mass extinction. With its breakup towards the south a new country named Pannotia is being created. Pannotia immediately was hit with a massive glaciation, creating a hostile environment. Here we find volcanic activities, which additionally contribute to the hostility of this newly created supercontinent. It is not a space associated with life, as only few species would be able to survive in such space. Except for some worms and microscopic life there is not much life possible. Just a vast landscape. No plants, no complex life, eerily similar to the bitter environment the Antarctic offers now.
**Devonian Period (419 to 359 million years ago)**
    Whilst slowly moving southwards, that hostile environment is gradually starting to change however. The glaciated time has eventually come to an end. Life is starting to come back to its marines. With the shallow seas being fitting places, sea sponges (Archaeocyathids) being one of its first inhabitants.  Aside from those reef builders we can also start to find some very fascinating two-shelled filter feeders known as Brachiopods. The marine-fauna starts flowering and contains an abundance of these shells, which essentially are filtering food out of water currents and then and then have the filtered water leave the shell again. Finally, there also are Trilobites on the ocean grounds. These bug-like creatures are decorated by an exoskeleton, whilst their underside consists of a soft membrane. But the sides also have rows of jointed limbs to offer, essentially creating a being that crawls on the ocean floor. With these three dominating the grounds of the waters, life slowly comes back all around us.
**Permian Period (299 to 250 million years ago)**
    Eventually, fish are also starting to appear. A distinct group of armored fish, called Placoderms, is dominating the ocean now. It is a fairly unique looking fish, probably related to sharks, with about 200 different versions of it. Generally, it looks similar to the shell of a turtle, with the same front legs on the sides, but smaller legs in the back, as well as a tail decorating the end of its shell. It gives the oceans life a whole new dimension, with now not only ground or reef bound creatures being there. But the marine is not the only thing that starts developing further. The swampy vast lands of the - by now - Gondwanan continent are being colonized by primitive ferns and mosses. By that we are not talking about some small green spots. The plants can be basically compared to jungles and forests nowadays. 1.5 meter tall fern shrubs have to fight for the sunlight with 30 meter tall trees. A complexity is born, created by the competing of plants for their survival. 
**Permian Period (250 million years ago)**
    Sadly however, once again, the newly created life has to end for a short while. One of the biggest - if not biggest - mass extinctions in history is about to occur. On - now - Antarctic land a meteor strikes, leaving a 482 kilometer wide crater. That makes the Island of Great Britain fit twice inside the crater! This means that in theory the entire world population is able to stand in this crater while still having a vast amount of space left. The direct impact itself only kills some of the continent's inhabitants, however, the aftermath does. Massive volcanism, changes in oxygen levels, sea levels and climate, drive many lives to an end. Survival of the fittest. And the species that cannot adjust to fit in, thus cant survive. Around 90% of the marine life and 70% of the terrestrial vertebrates on the entire planet die. Leaving an almost empty Antarctic continent with a huge crater left.
**Triassic and Jurassic Periods (250 to 145 million years ago)**
    Luckily, with life that survived, the continent repopulated quite quickly compared to the previous mass extinction. Slowly life rebounds and a vast majority of animals and plants appear. Alongside our previously present reef-buildinging sponges we now also start seeing corals develop. But not only do they make marine life more vibrant, we can also find ancient squids, microscopic plants (Phytoplankton), various fish, as well as giant reptiles that inhabit the seas. Especially, with Ichthyosaur on the rise, the ocean is flourishing with life once again. The dolphin-like reptiles offer a diversity of existence in the ocean. 
    Aside from the marine, we can also find a complex and diverse variety of plants once again. Like previously ferns, mosses and trees are dominantly overtaking some of the continent's firm terrain. The broad assortment is not ending here. With different types of Conifer (pine trees) forests, but also Ginkgo trees, it already creates a rather intriguing landscape. But Cycads, small palm-like plants, are also starting to appear, as well as Liverwort, a spore producing plant. It creates a more and more complex biome, that relies on each other but also fights each other for survival, similar to the ones we can find nowadays. That sort of medley environment also invites new lives into it. 
    With time we can gradually see more life appear, such as frogs, salamanders, crocodiles, turtles, snakes and even grasshoppers. More interestingly however, might be the appearance of dinosaurs and flying reptiles. Pterosaurs, reptiles with big wings and a long sharp face, are considered the first flying reptiles and are definitely dominating the sky, whilst on the ground we can find all types of dinosaurs. From the Eozostrodon - a one meter rat-like furred mammal - to the Coelophysis - a carnivorous two-meter long and slender dinosaur with a chicken-like posture. 
The supercontinent finally entirely splits up due to plate tectonics as well, and Antarctica, being part of Gondwana, is close to its final position at the south pole.

**Cretaceous Period (145 to 66 million years ago) **
	  For the following millions of years we keep finding this varsity of life on the Antarctic land. Plants, dinosaurs, many marine species, the bustling inhabited times are meant to last for quite a while. Now, for years, aside from the liveliness, the only significant change is signified in the Antarctic landmass further and further breaking apart from Gondwana and becoming its own independent continent. Additionally, whilst the climate is still warm, it does start to continuously cool down.
**Paleogene Period (66 to 34 million years ago)**
    Due to tectonic forces the continent keeps drifting southwards. The climate starts to drastically cool down and ice starts to develop. Thus, the living condition for most of the land's inhabitants is not further given. This leads to many of them dying, as they can't adjust to the new needs for survival, or if not dying, migrating to other continents. It marks the end of vivid life in Antarctica, only some sturdy plants of the forest remain. Furthermore the beginning of glacialisation. 
Early Oligocene Epoch (34 million years ago)
    Finally, Antarctica fully settles at the south pole. In the east of the continent the first ice sheets start to form and slowly everything gets taken over by ice sheet over ice sheet. Until we reach today. A white continent, full of secrets and history buried between twoXXX kilometers of ice. 

**Climate science and Antarctica's future** 
    Antarctica is a fascinating continent. Whilst we can puzzle together all these things that we just went through, we don't know most of it for sure yet, as the truth is buried under an immense amount of ice. However, this also does allow us to learn in entirely new ways about the past. Research has already found evidence of single celled live species in lakes under the Antarctic ice. Furthermore, there was also a disputed find of a new bacteria, which might have been a contaminated sample however. In the end we are only at the beginning of our discoveries made in Antarctica. There is a lot more to be explored and to be learned. It opens many opportunities to us, as we are given the opportunity to see life and the remains of it frozen in time. It essentially is like an easier to read book than many current fragments of the past. A book that gives you a detailed insight into what life really once was in those countries and what led to the enormous changes in climate. From which we can learn more about the past and seek deeper understanding of what to expect from the future.
